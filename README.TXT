Troubleshooting (things to try if you experience technical
problems running your game or receive error messages):

-- Close all open applications before starting your game.

--  Make sure you have over 70% resources available to Windows
before starting your game (check HELP option in Program Manager
to see how much resources are available).

--  Disable extended memory managers (e.g.  QEMM).

--  Turn off the music (menu:  options). If this solves the problem
check your windows and sound device manuals to make sure your
"MIDI device" is installed correctly.

-- Install your game to a drive that is not compressed with a disk
compression utility.
